DASL provides data from a wide variety of topics so that statistics teachers can find interesting, real-world examples for their students. We know a good example can make a lesson on a particular statistics method vivid and relevant. This website is designed to help teachers locate and identify datafiles for teaching as well as serve as an archive for datasets from statistics literature.

Here is a list of suggested project ideas for the mini-project for IRDS. If you wish, you may instead propose a project that is not on this list. At the bottom of this page, you will find some examples of datasets which we judged as inappropriate for the projects &ndash; this may help you to avoid some pitfalls.

R has a lot of built-in data come with different libraries. Data sets are structured and clean. They are used in different illlustrative exmaples. To use an R built-in data set, you need load the libray in which the data resides before you use it.

TCIA data are organized as &quot;collections&quot;; typically these are patient cohorts related by a common disease (e.g. lung cancer), image modality or type (MRI, CT, digital histopathology, etc) or research focus. Supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics and image analyses are also provided when available. Try using the filter box above the table to quickly find collections of interest using keywords. Column headers can also be clicked to change the sorting method.
